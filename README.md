# ASU-MathLab-2019

Overview:
Implement mathematical library software. Similar
to Matlab, Octave and similar tools.

Specifications:
● Using C/C++
● Development under linux
● Production to linux server (Centos 6.7)
● Any C/C++ IDE works under linux.
● g++ compiler, makefile is required.
● Source Control, Issue Tracking, Documents at Bitbucket

Phases:
1. Core operations (3 Weeks)
2. Advanced Operations and Tuning (3 Weeks)
3. Advanced system operations (4 Weeks after exams)

Phase 1: Core Operations
● Implement C++ class for matrix
● Support dynamic creation and destruction of matrices of any size
● Support addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose and division
● Process input user commands and show results directly
● Process input file, show each step result then exit

Phase 2: Advanced Operations and Tuning
● Support mathematical functions.
○ Trigonometric, Logarithmic, Roots, Power
● Support mathematical expressions.
○ Either with (dot) or not.
● Support flexible matrix parser.
○ Accept matrix in matrix, expressions and variables
● Support error handling.
○ Do not crash for invalid input.
